Java quick start
================

This section will show a simple example to illustrate various functionalities of the AMPL Java interface. 
The full example prints the version of the AMPL interpreter used, loads a model from file and the corresponding 
data file, solves it, gets some of the AMPL entities in Java and uses them to get the results and to assign data 
programmatically. This section assumes that you are already familiar with the Java language. Where screenshots are 
displayed, they refer to `Eclipse <http://www.eclipse.org>`_, a free development environment.
Full class reference is given in :ref:`secReferenceJava`.


Complete listing
----------------

This is the complete listing of the example. Please note that, for clarity of presentation, 
all the code in the examples below does not include exceptions handling.

.. code-block:: java


    // Create an AMPL instance
    AMPL ampl = new AMPL();

    /*
    // If the AMPL installation directory is not in the system search path:
    Environment env = new Environment(
        "full path to the AMPL installation directory");
    AMPL ampl = new AMPL(env);
    */

    try {
        // Interpret the two files
        ampl.read("models/diet.mod");
        ampl.readData("models/diet.dat");

        // Solve
        ampl.solve();

        // Get objective entity by AMPL name
        Objective totalcost = ampl.getObjective("Total_Cost");
        // Print it
        System.out.format("Objective is: %f%n", totalcost.value());

        // Reassign data - specific instances
        Parameter cost = ampl.getParameter("cost");
        cost.setValues(new Object[] { "BEEF", "HAM" }, new double[] { 5.01, 4.55 });
        System.out.println("Increased costs of beef and ham.");

        // Resolve and display objective
        ampl.solve();
        System.out.format("New objective value: %f%n", totalcost.value());

        // Reassign data - all instances
        cost.setValues(new double[] { 3, 5, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5.01, 4.55 });
        System.out.println("Updated all costs");

        // Resolve and display objective
        ampl.solve();
        System.out.format("New objective value: %f%n", totalcost.value());

        // Get the values of the variable Buy in a dataframe object
        Variable buy = ampl.getVariable("Buy");
        DataFrame df = buy.getValues();
        // Print them
        System.out.println(df);

        // Get the values of an expression into a DataFrame object
        DataFrame df2 = ampl.getData("{j in FOOD} 100*Buy[j]/Buy[j].ub");
        // Print them
        System.out.println(df2);
    } catch (IOException e) {
        System.out.println(e.getMessage());
    } finally {
        ampl.close();
    }
   

Create a project and add references
-----------------------------------

This section depends on the chosen development environment. The screenshots below refer to Eclipse.

Creating a new project
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Open Eclipse, choose an appropriate workspace and create a new Java project as shown in 
figure :ref:`figEclipseCreateProject`. 
Please note that the minimum required JRE is version 1.6.

.. _figEclipseCreateProject:

.. figure:: images/CreateProject.*

   :width: 371 px
   :height: 500 px
   :alt: Create a new project in eclipse
   :figClass: align-center
   
   Create a project
   


Add a reference to the AMPL Java library
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Right click on the project name, click on :guilabel:`Properties`, select the tab :guilabel:`Java Build Path` 
and in the tab :guilabel:`Libraries` click on :guilabel:`Add External JARs` (figure :ref:`figEclipseAddReferences`) 
and select the file **ampl-1.0.jar** which can be found in the AMPL API installation directory. 
This will give access to all the types and methods defined in the library. 
The reference AMPL API should now be visible in the Referenced Libraries folder in the Package Explorer.

.. _figEclipseAddReferences:

Java imports and AMPL environment creation
------------------------------------------

For a simple hello world program, first import the needed classes from the library, 
with the following statements:

.. code-block:: java

   import java.io.IOException;
   import com.ampl.AMPL;
   import com.ampl.DataFrame;
   import com.ampl.Objective;
   import com.ampl.Parameter;
   import com.ampl.Variable;

Then copy the following statements to have a hello world application which gets the value
of the option `version` as defined in the underlying AMPL executable and prints the result 
on the console. 

.. code-block:: java

   AMPL ampl = new AMPL();
   System.out.println(ampl.getOption("version"));

The first line creates a new Ampl object with all default settings.
The second, which is the preferred way to access AMPL options, gets the value of the option 
`version` from AMPL as a string and prints the result on the active console. 

Load a model from file
----------------------

The following lines use the method :java:ref:`AMPL.read` to load a model and data stored in external (AMPL) files. 
If the files are not found, an IOException is thrown.

.. code-block:: java

   ampl.read("models/diet.mod");
   ampl.readData("models/diet.dat");

Once these commands are executed, the AMPL interpreter will have interpreted the content of the two files. 
No further communication is made between the AMPL interpreter and the Java object, as every entity is created lazily (as needed).

Solve a problem
---------------

To solve the currently loaded problem instance, it is sufficient to issue the command:

.. code-block:: java

   ampl.solve();
   

Get an AMPL entity in the programming environment (get objective value)
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
AMPL API provides java representations of the AMPL entities. Usually, not all the entities are 
of interest for the programmer. The generic procedure is:

1. Identify the entities that need interaction (either data read or modification)
2. For each of these entities, create an object of the appropriate class in Java
3. Get the entity through the AMPL API using :java:ref:`AMPL.getEntity` or one of its type safe alternatives (:java:ref:`AMPL.getVariable`, :java:ref:`AMPL.getParameter`, :java:ref:`AMPL.getObjective`  , :java:ref:`AMPL.getSet`, :java:ref:`AMPL.getConstraint`)

.. code-block:: java

   Objective totalcost = ampl.getObjective("Total_Cost");
   System.out.format("Objective is: %f%n",totalcost.get().value());

It can be noted that we access an Objective to interrogate AMPL API about the objective function. 
It is a collections of objectives. To access the single instance, the function get() should be used in 
case of the objective, which gets the only instance of the objective. 
Since objectives are often single instance, the value() function has been implemented in the class :java:ref:`~ampl.Objective`. 
So, equivalently to the call above, the following call would return the same value, as it gives direct access 
to the objective function value:

.. code-block:: java

   totalcost.value();

The output of the program above is::

   Objective is: 118.05940323955669

Modify model data (assign values to parameters)
-----------------------------------------------

The input data of an optimisation model is stored in its parameters; these can be scalar or vectorial entities. 
Two ways are provided to change the value of vectorial parameter: change specific values or change all values at 
once. The example shows an example of both ways, reassigning the values of the parameter costs firstly specifically, 
then altogether. Each time, it then solves the model and get the objective function. The function used to change the 
values is overloaded, and is in both cases :java:ref:`Parameter.setValues`.

.. code-block:: java

   Parameter cost = ampl.getParameter("cost");
   cost.setValues( new Object[] { "BEEF", "HAM" }, new double[] { 5.01, 4.55 });
   System.out.println("Increased costs of beef and ham.");
   ampl.solve();
   System.out.format("New objective value: %f%n", totalcost.value());


The code above assigns the values 5.01 and 4.55 to the parameter cost for the objects beef and ham respectively.
If the order of the indexing of an entity is known (i.e. for multiple reassignment), it is not necessary to specify 
both the index and the value. A collection of values is assigned to each of the parameter values, in the order they are represented in AMPL.
 
.. code-block:: java

   cost.setValues(new double[] {3, 5, 5, 6, 1, 2, 5.01, 4.55 });
   System.out.println("Updated all costs");
   // Resolve and display objective
   ampl.solve();
   System.out.format("New objective value: %f%n", totalcost.value());

The statements above produce the following output::

   Objective is: 118.05940323955669
   Increased costs of beef and ham.
   New objective value: 144.41572037510653
   Updated all costs
   New objective value: 164.54375000000002 

Get numeric values from variables
---------------------------------

To access all the numeric values contained in a Variable or any other entity, use a :java:ref:`DataFrame` object. Doing so, the data is detached from 
the entity, and there is a considerable performance gain. To do so, we first get the Variable object from AMPL, then we get its data with the
function :java:ref:`Entity.getValues`.

.. code-block:: java

   // Get the values of the variable Buy in a dataframe object
   Variable buy = ampl.getVariable("Buy");
   DataFrame df = buy.getValues();
   // Print them
   System.out.println(df);
   


Get arbitrary values via ampl expressions
-----------------------------------------

Often we are interested in very specific values coming out of the optimization session. To make use of the power of AMPL expressions and avoiding
cluttering up the environment by creating entities, fetching data through arbitrary AMPL expressions is possible. For this model, we are interested
in knowing how close each decision variable is to its upper bound, in percentage.
We can obtain this data into a dataframe with the code:

.. code-block:: java

   // Get the values of an expression into a DataFrame object
   DataFrame df2 = ampl.getData("{j in FOOD} 100*Buy[j]/Buy[j].ub");
   // Print them
   System.out.println(df2);


Close the AMPL object to free the resources
-------------------------------------------

It is good practice to make sure that the AMPL object is closed and all its resources released when it is not needed anymore. 
This can be easily achieved by enclosing all the body of the program in a try block, and by calling the :java:ref:`AMPL.close` function in
the finally block.

.. code-block:: java

   AMPL ampl = new AMPL();
   try{
      // use ampl object here
   } finally{
      // close all AMPL related resources here
      ampl.close();
   }
