Constraint
==========

.. java:package:: com.ampl
   :noindex:

.. java:type:: public class Constraint extends BasicEntity<ConstraintInstance>

   This class represents an algebraic or logical constraint. In case the constraint is scalar, its values can be accessed via functions like :java:ref:`Constraint.body` and :java:ref:`Constraint.dual`. All the AMPL suffixes for constraints (see http://www.ampl.com/NEW/suffbuiltin.html) are available through methods of this class with the same name (and methods of :java:ref:`ConstraintInstance` for indexed constraints).

   Note that, since this class represents both algebraic and logical constraints, some suffixes might not be available for every entity.

   An :java:ref:`UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown if one of such methods is called for a non-scalar constraint and if a method corresponding to a suffix which is not supported by the type of the constraint is called.

   The instances, represented by the class :java:ref:`ConstraintInstance` can be accessed via the method :java:ref:`Constraint.get` (see section :ref:`secAccessInstancesAndValues` for further information on how to access instances).

   To gain access to all the values in an entity (for all instances and all suffixes for that entities), see :java:ref:`Entity.getValues` and the :java:ref:`DataFrame` class.

Methods
-------
astatus
^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public String astatus()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the current AMPL status (dropped, presolved, or substituted out)

body
^^^^

.. java:method:: public double body()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the current value of the constraint's body

defvar
^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public int defvar()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the index in \ ``_var``\  of "defined variable" substituted out by the constraint

dinit
^^^^^

.. java:method:: public double dinit()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the current initial guess for the constraint's dual variable

dinit0
^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public double dinit0()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the original initial guess for the constraint's dual variable

drop
^^^^

.. java:method:: public void drop()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Drop all instances in this constraint entity, corresponding to the AMPL code:

   .. parsed-literal::

      drop constraintname;

dual
^^^^

.. java:method:: public double dual()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the current value of the constraint's dual variable.

   Note that dual values are often reset by the underlying AMPL interpreter by the presolve functionalities triggered by some methods. A possible workaround is to set the option \ ``presolve``\  to ``false`` (see :java:ref:`AMPL.setBoolOption`).

get
^^^

.. java:method:: public ConstraintInstance get()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the constraint instance (to be used only on scalar constraints)

   :throws UnsupportedOperationException: if the constraint is not scalar.
   :return: The corresponding instance. @ throws IllegalStateException if the constraint has been deleted in the underlying AMPL interpreter

get
^^^

.. java:method:: public ConstraintInstance get(Object... key)
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the constraint instance corresponding to the specified key. See :ref:`secAccessInstancesAndValues` for further information on how the key can be specified.

   :param key: The key to be found
   :throws IllegalArgumentException: if trying to access an instance with the wrong number of keys (see :java:ref:`Entity.indexarity`)
   :throws IllegalStateException: if the entity has been deleted in the underlying AMPL interpreter
   :return: The constraint instance corresponding to the specified key. Returns ``null`` if the specified key is not present.

get
^^^

.. java:method:: public ConstraintInstance get(Tuple key)
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the constraint instance corresponding to the specified key, expressed as a Tuple. See :ref:`secAccessInstancesAndValues` for further information on how the key can be specified.

   :param key: The indexing Tuple of the instance to be found
   :throws IllegalArgumentException: if trying to access an instance with the wrong indexarity (see :java:ref:`Entity.indexarity`)
   :throws IllegalStateException: if the entity has been deleted in the underlying AMPL interpreter
   :return: The constraint instance corresponding to the specified key. Returns ``null`` if the specified key is not present.

impl
^^^^

.. java:method::  ConstraintBase impl()
   :outertype: Constraint

isLogical
^^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public boolean isLogical()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Check if the constraint is a logical constraint. The available suffixes differ between logical and non logical constraints. See http://www.ampl.com/NEW/suffbuiltin.html for a list of the available suffixes for algebraic constraints. The suffixes available for logical constraints are marked on the method description by "Valid only for logical constraints".

   :return: True if logical

iterator
^^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: @Override public Iterator<ConstraintInstance> iterator()
   :outertype: Constraint

lb
^^

.. java:method:: public double lb()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the current value of the constraint's lower bound

lbs
^^^

.. java:method:: public double lbs()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the constraint lower bound sent to the solver (reflecting adjustment for fixed variables)

ldual
^^^^^

.. java:method:: public double ldual()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the current dual value associated with the lower bound

lslack
^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public double lslack()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the slack at lower bound \ ``body - lb``\

restore
^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public void restore()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Restore all instances in this constraint entity, corresponding to the AMPL code:

   .. parsed-literal::

      restore constraintname;

setDual
^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public void setDual(double dual)
   :outertype: Constraint

   Set the value of the dual variable associated to this constraint (valid only if the constraint is scalar). Equivalent to the AMPL statement:

   .. parsed-literal::

      let c := dual;

   Note that dual values are often reset by the underlying AMPL interpreter by the presolve functionalities triggered by some methods. A possible workaround is to set the option \ ``presolve``\  to ``false`` (see :java:ref:`AMPL.setBoolOption`).

   :param dual: The value to be assigned to the dual variable

slack
^^^^^

.. java:method:: public double slack()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Constraint slack (the lesser of lslack and uslack)

sstatus
^^^^^^^

.. java:method:: public String sstatus()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the solver status (basis status of constraint's slack or artificial variable)

status
^^^^^^

^^^

.. java:method:: public double val()
   :outertype: Constraint

   Get the AMPL val suffix. Valid only for logical constraints.
